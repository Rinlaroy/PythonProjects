# Metal Surface Defect Detection

Metal Surface Defect Detection is a PyQt-based application for detecting defects on metal surfaces using a pre-trained deep learning model.

### Prerequisites

To run the application, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3
- PyQt5
- Keras
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

Usage :
Run the application:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
The application will open with a GUI allowing you to upload an image containing a metal surface with possible defects.

Click on the "UPLOAD IMAGE" button, browse and select the image from your file system.

The application will process the image using the pre-trained model and display the result in the "RESULT" section.

Model
The deep learning model used in this application has been trained on a dataset of metal surface images with various defects. It uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for defect classification.
